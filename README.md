# 👋 Hi there, I'm Ali Ezzat
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a data scientist who is specialized in machine learning and passionate about solving complex problems through data science, with a strong focus on generative AI and building impactful applications using natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs).

- 🔭 **Current Role:** Chief Data Scientist at [Synapse Analytics](https://synapse-analytics.io/)
- 🌱 **Education:** PhD in Computer Science & MSc in Bioinformatics from Nanyang Technological University

## 🍳 What's cooking these days
I am mostly working on the "Life with" repos here on my GitHub:
  - [Life with DL](https://github.com/alizat/Life-with-DL)  -->  general deep learning
  - [Life with Graphs](https://github.com/alizat/Life-with-Graphs)  -->  analysis and prediction on graphs
  - [Life with LLMs](https://github.com/alizat/Life-with-LLMs)  -->  LLMs, RAG, Agents, etc.
  - [Life with NLP](https://github.com/alizat/Life-with-NLP)  -->  NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, summarization, question answering, etc.
  - [Life with Recs](https://github.com/alizat/Life-with-Recs)  -->  recommender systems

I have my own pet projects that I work on from time to time:
  - [HEROIC Surfer](https://github.com/alizat/heroic_surfer)
    - [HEROIC](https://www.heroic.us/) is a self-development platform that provides lots of content (book summaries, daily wisdom videos, meditations, etc.)
    - I am currently scraping the HEROIC website.
    - With what I am scraping, I intend to build a LLM-powered Shiny app that lets you explore the HEROIC database.
  - [BGG Scraper](https://github.com/alizat/bggscraper)
    - [Board Game Geek (BGG)](https://boardgamegeek.com/) is an encyclopedic website that has all kinds of information on all board games ine existence.
    - I developed many functions for scraping different kinds of board game info. Most of these functions made use of the [BGG's XML API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2).
